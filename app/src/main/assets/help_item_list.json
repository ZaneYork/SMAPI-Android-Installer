      "content": "<a href=\"https://smapi.io/mods\">There</a> are many mods, but not directly url available for download, just to tell you if it is compatible. There are four colors: green, yellow, gray, and red. The green indicates that mod satisfied with the latest version of smapi and the latest version of the game (this is for PC, The mobile is basically the same, but some of them are not), and there are nexus links to provide downloads (the second column). The yellow part indicates that there is a problem with this mod. The author may not update it right now, but it is open source. Some other developer have updated unofficial version for it. The nexus link is not available. The penultimate column provides the unofficial version unofficial version. The mod in the gray part is broken, but there is no fix for it. Generally, there will be mods with similar functions in the penultimate column (may not). You can choose to use the another one. Red is completely abandoned, so there is no link, try another instead."
